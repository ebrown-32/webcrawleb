Born and raised in Germany, educated in the United States and now based out of South Korea, BAFTA Awards-nominated actor Teo Yoo (âPast Lives,â âDecision to Leaveâ) doesnât take any of his success for granted. He had already spent many years turning down parts that cast Asian characters in a disparaging light. In his latest role in the espionage series âThe Recruit,â he plays Jang Kyu, a South Korean intelligence agent, who teams up with Noah Centineo (âTo All the Boysâ trilogy). âThis show is a testament to Alexi Hawleyâs writing and also to the leadership of [executive producer and star] Noah, who created such a warm and lovely environment for us all,â Yoo said in an interview from The Plaza Hotel in New York City. âIt was a very wholesome experience and a privilege to be part of the show.â The second season of âThe Recruitâ will drop on Netflix Jan. 30. Yoo stays in touch with fans on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/teoyoo/). This interview was edited for length and clarity.
